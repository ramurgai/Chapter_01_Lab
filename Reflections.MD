1.) The most challenging part of translating Python concepts to Java syntax was the need to have specific data types for the variables. 
Certain methods could only be used in certain data types so I needed to do some trial and error to figure out how to do the things I wanted to do.

2.) I did not use any AI for any of the tasks.

3.) I didn't have anything in Java that I liked better than Python yet. I think there might be a some things that I find out that I like after I work with java more.
